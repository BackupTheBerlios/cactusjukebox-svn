HOWTO Create a new translation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At first you need to create a new .po file for your 
language with make_po.sh

$cd languages
$./make_po.sh

This creates cactus.po 
The .po filename should be from type 'cactus.language.po'
where language is the abbreviation for your language.
i.e.	en - englisch
	de - german
	fr - french
	gr - greece
	...

type 

$ mv cactus.po cactus.yourlanguage.po

Now open this file with a text editor. It contains many entries 
like this one:

#: mp3:rsquit
msgid "Quit"
msgstr ""

All you have to do is to write the translation of the word after 'msgid'
into the quotes after 'msgstr'
Afterwards save the .po file as utf8-encoded text.

If you want to test the translated strings you have to create a binary .mo 
file from the .po file. This is done by

$msgfmt cactus.yourlanguage.po -o cactus.yourlanguage.mo

If the .mo file is in the Cactus jukebox 'languages' directory it 
should now be chooseable from the settings menu.
(If you have installed from rpm/deb package the folder 
is at /usr/share/cactusjukebox/languages)

That's all! Please send the translated .po(!) file to the author at
sebastian_kraft*AT*gmx.de, and he will include it as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance for your contribution!
